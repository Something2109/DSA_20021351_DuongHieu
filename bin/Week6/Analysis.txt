When the size of the array is doubly increased:
- Insertion Sort: processing time increased by around 4 times.
- Merge Sort: processing time increased by around 2 times.
- Randomized Quick Sort: processing time increased by around 2 times.
- Quick Sort without randomized: processing time is likely to be less than randomized.

With the same size of array:
- Insertion Sort: processing time difference between sorted array and random one is pretty huge (almost double the time).
- Merge Sort: processing time has no big difference among all the situation.
- Randomized Quick Sort: processing time is roughly the same as the Merge Sort's.
- Quick Sort: Sorted Array and Reverse Sorted Array are easily causing StackOverFlow with a large size.
