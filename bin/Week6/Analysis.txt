When the size of the array is doubly increased:
- Insertion Sort: processing time increased by around 4 times.
- Merge Sort: processing time increased by around 2 times.
- Randomized Quick Sort: processing time increased by around 2 times.

With the same size of array:
- Insertion Sort: processing time difference between sorted array and reverse-sorted one is pretty huge (0 - 15319)
- Merge Sort: processing time has no big difference among all the situation (12 - 13ms)
- Randomized Quick Sort:
